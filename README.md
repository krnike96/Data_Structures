## About

This repository is a personal project where I document my progress in learning and implementing data structures. It serves as a reference for myself and anyone interested in understanding how data structures work and how they can be implemented in code.

## Data Structures Covered

Here are the data structures I've implemented so far:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked Lists

*(I'll continue to add more data structures as I learn!)*

## Languages Used

- **C**
- **C++**

*(Feel free to suggest or contribute implementations in other languages!)*
