## About

This repository is a personal project where I document my progress in learning and implementing data structures. It serves as a reference for myself and anyone interested in understanding how data structures work and how they can be implemented in code.

Created on : March 2025

## Data Structures Covered

Here are the data structures I've implemented so far:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked Lists
- **Queue**
  - Normal Queue using Array
  - Circular Queue using Array
  - Priority Queue (Max-Heap Based)
- **Stack**
  - Stack using Array
- **Hashing**
  - Hashing NoSafety
  - Hashing Open Hashing/Separate Chaining
- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort

*(I'll continue to add more data structures as I learn!)*

## Languages Used

- **C**
- **C++**

*(Feel free to suggest or contribute implementations in other languages!)*
